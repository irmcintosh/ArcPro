# Military Mobility Corridor Analysis

This repository demonstrates a GIS-based workflow for analyzing military mobility corridors using ArcGIS Pro. The animation illustrates the key steps in creating and analyzing mobility corridors based on terrain and obstacle data.

## Features Demonstrated

1. **Base Map and Data Setup**
   - A hybrid reference layer and a world imagery basemap (Firefly) are loaded to provide spatial context.

2. **Mobility Corridor Classification**
   - Different classes of mobility are visualized:
     - Unrestricted
     - Restricted
     - Severely Restricted

3. **Obstacle Analysis**
   - Obstacles are overlaid on the map, restricting mobility in certain areas.

4. **Task Workflow**
   - The "Military Mobility Corridor" task panel guides the user through:
     - Exploring the military mobility corridor
     - Setting up mobility corridor data
     - Generating obstacle layers
     - Finalizing the corridor analysis

5. **References**
   - Based on military doctrine such as:
     - ADP 3-0
     - ATP 2-01.3
     - FM 3-34

## How to Use

1. Open the project in ArcGIS Pro.
2. Follow the task panel on the right to complete the analysis workflow.
3. Customize the obstacle layers or basemap for your specific region of interest.
